      <description>Avoiding Avoidable Component Re-renders  Over the last few weeks I spent some time making performance improvements to a data-reporting front-end we build and maintain at Vena Solutions. The application is built entirely in React and has grown to the point where we are starting to notice sluggish performance in certain views and features — especially those tasked with rendering many sub-components (lists and trees).</description>

      <description>Over the last few months at work our team had the opportunity to give some love to one of our core codebases — a JavaScript add-in (henceforth known as the JSAddin) embedded in Office365. The project was built under tight time constraints and quickly became a pain to extend and maintain.</description>

      <description>Kyle Simpson, writer of the series “You Don’t Know JS”, said the following — “understanding closures is like when Neo sees the Matrix for the first time”. If you don’t understand the reference please come back after you’ve watched The Matrix (1999). I admit this concept took me a while to grasp and for a long time I walked around with inaccurate beliefs about what a closure really was!</description>

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token   …were a normal part of my development process. My code was full of poor practices (even when it worked!</description>

      <description>As the complexity of a web application increases, manual testing of front-end functionality can no longer provide a reasonable level of confidence. Time that used to be spent developing new features is now spent fixing an increasing number of regression issues…
