## Background

Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams was originally written in 1987 (and more recently revised in 2013) by software consultants Tom DeMarco and Tom Lister. The core assertion of the book is that <i>"the major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature"</i>. The book tackles topics around human resource management, the office environment, and strategies for growing productive teams.

## Why I Read This Book

This book is on many "must read" lists. I actually like the fact that it was written in 1987 as it's fascinating to see how lessons learned 30 years ago are still applicable today.

## Takeaways

### <i>Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity</i>

Emotions are often tied to the quality of the product that is being produced, not the quantity. The emotional benefit from producing high quality software can actually lead to higher productivity and lower costs. In Japan the trade-off between price and quality does not exist because they are complementary in nature.

### <i>Parkinson's law almost certainly does not apply to your people</i>

A 1985 study by Jeffery-Lawrence demonstrated that the average productivity of a programmer was by far the highest when no schedule pressure was applied. The average productivity was the worst when the supervisor provided an estimated schedule.

### <i>Minimum accomodations for a software worker slated to occupy a new space: 100 sqft space and 30 sqft work surface / person.</i>

The numbers above were sourced from a study conducted by IBM for its Santa Teresa facility. I currently work in an open office and the idea of having 100 sqft of space sounds like a myth in the current tech office landscape. The book goes on to discuss office layouts, sound proofing, doors, windows, team workspaces and more - many things which might be tough to find in a modern workplace.

### <i>Your people bring their brains with them every morning. They could put them to work for you at no additional cost if only there were a small measure of peace and quiet in the workspace</i>

Another one related to workspaces, but I couldn't agree more.

### <i>Successful learning organizations are always characterized by strong middle management</i>

Wait...what does middle management even do? It turns out that one of those things may be organizational learning. Tom&Tom make the assertion that company executives are too busy dealing with acquisitions and people on the ground rarely have the opportunity to affect change - leaving the middle management to drive most of the organizational learning.

### <i>Factors that lead to Teamicide: Defensive Management, Bureaucracy, Physical Separation, Fragmentation of People's Time, Quality Reduction of Product, Phony Deadlines, Clique Control</i>

Enough said?

### <i>The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment</i>

I absolutely love this statement. Alignment implies an emotional connection to the product or the mission and people who feel great about what they do will perform at their best. Thinking about "jelling" between team members should come first when trying to build productive teams.
